    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, signed a pledge that if elected she will continue to use Participatory Budgeting as a method of allocating $1 Million of the capital budget. </p>
    <p>"Everyone who pays taxes deserves a say in how their tax dollars will be spent" Chrissy said. "Participatory Budgeting brings everyone together in order to decide how public money is best spent in our community."</p>
    <p>Participatory Budgeting was first used in District 19 during the fiscal year 2014 budget cycle and was widely successful. Project ideas were submitted by dozens of residents from all across Northeast Queens. Committees then met to research projects, determine costs, and finalize a ballot of 18 projects. Every resident was then invited to vote on how they wanted their tax dollars spent. Over 1100 people voted, 7 projects were selected and hundreds of people were engaged with the City's budget process. </p>
    <p>"The response to Participatory Budgeting last year was simply amazing. Everyone involved with the project showed incredible dedication and passion for making our neighborhood better. Hundreds of people showed up to vote with zeal for the projects they were supporting" Chrissy continued.</p>
    <p>The pledge which Chrissy signed, and urged the other candidates to sign, called for a commitment to continuing Participatory Budgeting in District 19, making voting available to every resident, and making all funding decision in a transparent manner among other things. </p>
    <p>"Participatory Budgeting is a hallmark of transparent government. My vote counted the same as all 1169 other participants. The wide range of projects that were selected showed that people really do care about their community. Failing to continue Participatory Budgeting would be to deny the district access to very important part of government, the budget" Chrissy concluded. "Good things happen when everyone works together."</p>
    <p>A total of 8 council districts participated in participatory budgeting last year.</p>
