    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian has filed paperwork with the New York City Campaign Finance Board to run for the New York City Council in the 19th District.</p>
    <p>Chrissy is a lifelong resident of the Auburndale section of North Flushing. She has very strong ties to the community where she owns her home and raised her two children. Chrissy believes that her combination of her business, civic, and community experience makes her an ideal candidate for City Council.</p>
    <p>Chrissy has 31 years of business experience, retiring as a top executive in the telecommunications industry. She is the Vice President of the Station Road Civic Association, which she co-founded in 2005 in order to establish a working relationship between the neighborhood and the local business community. </p>
    <p>Since 2008 Chrissy has been the President of the 109th Precinct Community Council, which she helped grow to one of the largest in the City. Under Chrissy’s leadership the 109th Precinct Community Council regularly attracts over 100 people to its monthly meetings, and nearly 3000 people to the annual National Night Out Against Crime. These events, and many others like them, establish a strong partnership between the police department and the community. </p>
    <p>Finally after retiring from the corporate world, Chrissy went to work at the New York City Council. First as Director of Constituent Services, and later as Chief of Staff, Chrissy oversaw 8,000 constituent cases, the allocation of nearly $10 million to Northeast Queens, and she helped develop a strong working relationship between the government and the community.</p>
    <p>Chrissy plans to bring her 30+ years of business expertise and extensive community, civic, and government experience to the City Council. She hopes that every family who lives in Northeast Queens will be able to share her story of hard work, determination, and commitment to her neighborhood. In her family, business career, civic, and police- community roles she worked with everyone as a close-knit team to achieve countless goals and then always celebrated their successes together. She brings the same vision to the race for Council District 19.</p>
