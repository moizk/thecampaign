    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, announced her opposition to a bill currently being considered in the City Council that would make it illegal for a police officer to identify a suspect's age, gender, color or disability. Officers would be limited to providing descriptions of suspects based only on their clothing. </p>
    <p>"This bill, if passed, would make it absolutely impossible for the NYPD to investigate or solve any crime” Chrissy said. "You can't put up wanted posters that only identifies a suspect's clothing. "</p>
    <p>The bill, which is aimed at curbing racial profiling, goes too far and prevents officers from engaging in basic police work. Descriptions of suspects routinely include the suspect's gender, race, or estimated age. These descriptions are used to inform officers and the public to be on the look out for certain individuals who may be suspects in a crime. Preventing the NYPD from using these descriptive features means that officers are forced to fight crime without knowing what the criminals look like.</p>
    <p>"Working with the NYPD for the past 6 years I have learned that a strong relationship between the police department and the community is vital to solving crime” Chrissy continued. There have been countless times where we have circulated photos or descriptions to the community and asked for their help identifying suspects. You can't ask the community for help identifying someone based on what they were wearing at the time of the crime. The only people this bill protects are the bad guys.”</p>
    <p>Every law enforcement union in the City opposes the bill, and the Captains Benevolent Association has begun sponsoring advertisements to alert the public to the dangers of passing this bill.</p>
