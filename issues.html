    <div class=" issue">
      <div class="page-header"><h4 id="publicsafety">Public Safety</h4></div>
      <p>If I have learned anything the past five years working with the police department, it is that the best crime fighting tool is the public. It is up to each and every single one of us to help the police department by reporting suspicious or illegal activity to 911. </p>
      <p>As a Councilwoman I will work hard to create a stronger relationship between the police and fire departments, and the communities that they protect. I believe that allowing people to send text messages to 911, or to submit photos of suspicious individuals and vehicles will go a long way to making our neighborhoods safer. The tragic events in Boston showed that when the public works together to fight crime, criminals stand no chance. </p>
      <p>I also believe that we need more police officers and firefighters in our community. When it comes to an emergency every second matters. Public safety should NEVER be compromised to save a few dollars. I pledge that I will not vote for any budget that includes closures of firehouses or police stations. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
      <div class="page-header"><h4 id="education">Education</h4></div>
      <p>We are lucky to live in an area that has two of the best school districts in the City. Many people moved to this community just for the schools. However, fighting between the City and various unions has cost our students millions of dollars. Teachers are over worked and underpaid, they have one of the greatest responsibilities of any society, molding the minds of our kids. We cannot let disagreements get in the way of helping our children. </p>
      <p>In addition to helping create a better working relationship between teachers and the City, it is the responsibility of your elected officials to make sure that our local schools are the best that they can be. I will fight hard for funding to our schools, and make sure that every student has access to a computer while in school.</p>
      <p>Our community has also seen the closure of three local Catholic schools in the past 4 years.  Many other private schools are at risk. Parents who chose to send their children to private school should not be punished by the City with exorbitant taxes and cut backs to school nurses, school bus service or other services that help keep our students safe so that they can learn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
      <div class="page-header"><h4 id="jobs">Jobs</h4></div>
      <p>I started working when I was 16 years old and then spent 31 years in business. I am the only candidate in this race with significant business experience. Bureaucrats don't know how to create jobs, they have never managed a sales team, or worked with global partners to expand a business. </p>
      <p>I will bring my knowledge and experience in the business world to the City Council. We should encourage growth and expansion. It should not be more profitable for a business to open in Nassau County or New Jersey then it is to open in Whitestone or Bayside. </p>
      <p>The solution is simple, reduce taxes and reduce regulations on businesses. Provide incentives to small business owners that reward them for hiring local people. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
      <div class="page-header"><h4 id="budget">Budget</h4></div>
      <p>I have experience working with million dollar budgets and ensuring that every penny is wisely spent.  I will fight tirelessly for funding to our schools, parks, senior centers, and libraries. I will use my discretionary funding to support institutions and organizations that have a real impact in Northeast Queens.</p>
      <p>I pledge to continue the Participatory Budgeting program that allows residents to submit ideas of projects to be funded and then vote on which projects receive money. There is no greater example of transparent democracy then allowing you to decide where your tax dollars go.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
      <div class="page-header"><h4 id="cityservices">City Services</h4></div>
      <p>I am tired of paying more taxes for fewer services. Bus and subways fares are going up while service is going down. Water rates are skyrocketing. Cut backs in the sanitation department means less reliable garbage pick up. A tough economy is not an excuse to reduce the services that New Yorkers expect and deserve. </p>
