    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, condemned the passage of the "Community Safety Act" by the City Council today. The Council voted 34-15 to override Mayor Bloomberg's vetoes of the two bills which will seriously limit the ability of the NYPD to police proactively. The "Community Safety Act" was originally intended to improve relationships between the NYPD and certain communities, however it opens individual officers and the department as a whole up to frivolous lawsuits relating to stop, question and frisk, and it prevents officers from providing descriptions of dangerous suspects using race, gender or age.   Additionally the new law creates an NYPD Inspector General who is now the third different official with oversight over NYPD policies following the Police Commissioner and a court appointed monitor.</p>
    <p>"The men and women of the NYPD work hard to make New York the safest big city in America" said Chrissy. "Today's vote by the City Council undermines the work of every single police officer in the City. The Community Safety Act tells the police department that they don't know how to fight crime. This is a victory for the criminals and a bad day for the safety of New York City."</p>
    <p>"We need legislators who are willing to work with and listen to the experts" Chrissy continued. "It has been proven over and over again that stop, question and frisk discourages and prevents crime. Earlier this week the NYPD arrested gun smugglers who feared being stopped, questioned and frisked by the police, this is the strongest possible proof that proactive policing prevents crime. We cannot afford to return to crime rates of the 70s and 80s. There are thousands of New Yorkers alive today thanks to the practices of the NYPD."</p>
    <p>Chrissy has served as President of the 109th Precinct Community Council since 2009 and is an outspoken advocate of proactive policing as a tool used to prevent crime.</p>
