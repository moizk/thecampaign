    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Over a dozen women from across Northeast Queens rallied in support of Chrissy Voskerichian, for City Council on Sunday. Chrissy is seeking to become the first female Council Member to represent Northeast Queens since the Council reorganized in 1993.</p>
    <p>"It is an honor to be joined by so many wonderful ladies" Chrissy said. "Women have a unique point of view and way of getting things done. Nothing can better qualify you to be a problem solver than being a mother."</p>
    <p>Currently only 29% of the City's elected offices are held by women, and there are only 3 female Council Members from Queens. According to a Daily News analysis, only 30% of the candidates for City Council in Queens are women.</p>
    <p>"I have been a working mom for 26 years. It takes a lot to be able to raise a family and be successful in business at the same time. Every mother knows what it is like to juggle appointments to make sure that your kids have every opportunity. The sacrifices women make for their families cannot be measured" Chrissy concluded.</p>
    <p>The pledge which Chrissy signed, and urged the other candidates to sign, called for a commitment to continuing Participatory Budgeting in District 19, making voting available to every resident, and making all funding decision in a transparent manner among other things. </p>
    <p>Chrissy's Auburndale neighborhood has not been represented in the City or State government by a locally elected woman in over 20 years.</p>
