    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, called upon members of the City Council to vote against Intro 1079 and 1080, collectively known as the "Community Safety Act."  Mayor Bloomberg vetoed both bills on Tuesday calling them "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Intro 1079 would create an NYPD Inspector General with the power to change department policy, circumventing and diluting the powers already granted to the Police Commissioner. Intro 1080 would prevent police officers from using race, gender, or age as a factor in deciding to stop, question, and frisk potential suspects.</p>
    <p>"These bills effectively end the practice of stop, question, and frisk, and they seriously limit the ability of the NYPD to police proactively" said Chrissy. "The result will be more guns on the street, more drugs in our neighborhoods and a serious negative impact to our public safety and quality of life."</p>
    <p>The bills, which the Council voted on at 3 am on June 27th less than 48 hours after they were discharged from committee, passed with the 34 votes necessary to override a mayoral veto. However, outrage from citizens and an aggressive campaign by law enforcement may convince some Council Members to change their votes. There were 6 Council Members including Council Member Halloran, who Chrissy is running to replace in the Council, who voted for Intro 1079, the Inspector General bill, but voted against Intro 1080.</p>
    <p>"Every New Yorker is urged to call their Council Member and ask them to vote against these bills and vote in favor of public safety" Chrissy continued. "I call on Councilman Halloran to change his vote and oppose the NYPD Inspector General. This bill is redundant and could result in policies that conflict or are not in the best interest of the NYPD, the officers, and the general safety of New Yorkers. The only people these bills protect are the criminals." </p>
    <p>Chrissy has been an outspoken advocate of stop, question, and frisk as a tool used to police proactively in order to prevent crime. The Council is expected to vote on the Mayor's veto at the next stated meeting.</p>
