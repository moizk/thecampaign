    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, supports the idea of turning Flushing Airport in College Point into a park, but not as part of a land trade that would build a soccer stadium in Flushing Meadows Park.</p>
    <p>"The people of College Point deserve to utilize this space as park land" Chrissy said, "but the people of Corona also deserve their own park land and they shouldn't have to travel miles to get to it."</p>
    <p>Chrissy noted that in recent years the City has burdened College Point with numerous projects and development, with little in return.</p>
    <p>"Where is the trade for the Police Academy? Where is the trade for the waste transfer station or for the dozens of acres of airport land that were sold years ago for large scale development?" Chrissy asked. "This area already has major parking and traffic problems. There is a road adjacent to the airport that is in horrible condition, and second street that has been under construction for years. The last thing College Point needs is thousands of displaced soccer players coming into the area creating more traffic and parking problems."</p>
    <p>Chrissy suggested that the City work with the College Point community and the Economic Development Corporation to create a park in the Flushing Airport site that would be used for passive recreation.</p>
    <p>"Flushing Airport is a beautifully preserved piece of nature in the middle of an industrial area" Chrissy concluded. "The City should create pathways, install benches, plant trees, and improve the existing natural marshes. We should not bulldoze something virtually untouched since 1984 to build soccer fields as part of swap for property miles away."</p>
    <p>If elected, Chrissy would be a major advocate for expanding the existing parkland in Northeast Queens. Chrissy would also fight to keep resources in communities where they are most needed.</p>
