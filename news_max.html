    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, has raised enough money to qualify for the maximum amount of matching funds permitted by the Campaign Finance Board. Chrissy has raised $15,920 from New York City residents as of July 11th, which exceeds the threshold required to receive $92,400 from the City's matching funds program.</p>
    <p>"Our campaign hit the ground running on May 1st, and in just over 60 days we qualified for the maximum amount of matching funds, something that takes other campaigns much longer" said Chrissy. "The response from neighbors and friends, both new and old, has been simply overwhelming. I am so grateful to the hundreds of people who have contributed to my campaign or offered to volunteer."</p>
    <p>Under the matching funds program, the Campaign Finance Board matches every dollar contributed to a campaign from a New York City resident 6 to 1. In order to qualify for the maximum matching funds, a City Council candidate must raise at least $15,400 from City residents. Contributions from City residents over $175 are not matched, neither are contributions from people who live outside the five boroughs, or contributions from individuals who do business with the City.</p>
    <p>Chrissy has raised a total of $20,035 including the contributions that do not qualify for matching funds. 62% of the money Chrissy has raised came from residents of the 19th Council District. The average contribution that Chrissy received is just $72, far below that of other campaigns that rely on big donors. Chrissy has not hosted a fundraiser, and has not accepted any contributions from unions, PACs, or lobbyists. </p>
    <p>"The many small contributions I received from residents of the district inspire me to work even harder" Chrissy continued. "A $10 contribution from a senior means more to me than any big check from a super PAC ever could. The residents of Northeast Queens have the most at stake in this election."</p>
