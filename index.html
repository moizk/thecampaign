  “I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who volunteered their time in support of our campaign. My family, friends, and neighbors have been right next to me every step of the way for the last four months and who worked very hard day and night.  I will never be able to thank you enough. If I accomplished anything during this campaign, I hope that I showed people that they can, and should, expect more out of their elected officials. I look forward to continuing my work in the community and doing everything I can to make the neighborhood that I call home a better place to live”
