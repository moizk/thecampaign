    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Former Council Member Julia Harrison (D-Flushing) announced her support of Chrissy Voskerichian for City Council in Northeast Queens. Harrison represented parts of Northeast Queens in the City Council for 16 years between 1986 and 2001 before term limits forced her retirement. Harrison has worked with Chrissy through the 109th Precinct Community Council to resolve concerns in her neighborhood.</p>
    <p>"I have watched with great pleasure and interest the activities of a spirited, dedicated and creative lady named Chrissy, who has entered the Primary Election campaign to become the voice of the people in the 19th Council District" said Julia Harrison.</p>
    <p>"Chrissy is a married woman with two grown children and a supportive and encouraging husband of 29 years.  She has deep roots in her community and counts among her many volunteer activities her leadership as President of the 109th Precinct Community Council" Harrison continued.</p>
    <p>"With Chrissy as our Councilwoman, we will have the strong voice of  a leader of integrity, devoted to helping people, thoroughly aware of our cares and community concerns. It is my honor and privilege to endorse Chrissy for election to become our Councilwoman on Tuesday, September 10th!" Julia Harrison concluded.</p>
    <p>"I am very honored to have Julia Harrison's support" Chrissy said. "I am even more proud to call Julia a friend and mentor. For 16 years she represented Northeast Queens, and she always stood up for what she believed in and never backed down. We need more strong women like Julia Harrison in the City Council."</p>
    <p>Harrison was first elected to public office as an Assembly Member in 1983. She represented parts of North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside and Bay Terrace in the City Council from 1986 until 1993 before the Council redistricted and Harrison was then elected to represent the 20th Council District until 2001. She was most recently elected Democratic District Leader of the former 22nd Assembly District in 2010.</p>
