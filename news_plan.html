    <div class="about-body">
    <p>On the eve of National Night Out Against Crime, Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, released a plan that would help build relationships between the police department and the communities they serve. Chrissy's proposal titled "Plan for Improving Communications and Relationships between Communities and Police" is an alternative to the controversial Community Safety Act which is currently before the City Council.  The Community Safety Act, creates an NYPD Inspector General and prohibits officers from using race, gender, or age as a factor in deciding to stop, question, and frisk potential suspects.</p>
    <p>The Community Safety Act was original proposed as a method of improving relationships between the police and certain communities. However, it has been widely criticized by law enforcement and Mayor Bloomberg called the bills "dangerous" and "irresponsible" in his veto message. Chrissy's plan will achieve many of the same goals as the Community Safety Act without taking away the ability of the NYPD to police proactively.</p>
    <p>"We cannot handcuff our police officers with legislation that makes it impossible to police proactively" said Chrissy. "We need to think outside the box and find alternatives that will mend these relationships without compromising the safety of New Yorkers."</p>
    <p>Chrissy's plan presents four points to focus on in order to open a dialogue between the NYPD and the communities they serve. Each point is taken from Chirssy's personal experience working with the NYPD for the last 6 years. As President of the 109th Precinct Community Council, Chrissy is able to hear concerns from members of the community and work with the officers to address those issues.</p>
    <p>"Our leaders need to take the time to sit down and listen to the concerns of the community, and talk to the officers and try to find solutions that benefit everyone" Chrissy continued. "The Community Safety Act will result in more guns on the street and more dangerous neighborhoods. This is certainly not the way to improve relationships."</p>
    <p>Chrissy has been an outspoken advocate of stop, question, and frisk as a tool used to police proactively in order to prevent crime. Three of the four points in Chrissy's plan could be accomplished through changes in Department policy at minimal expense. </p>
