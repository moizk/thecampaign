    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to revise its budget and financial projections in order to reduce or eliminate the need to increase transit fares. Chrissy has extensive business experience and believes that with better management and cost reductions the MTA can keep service at the same levels without raising the price of Metrocards.</p>
    <p>"I spent 31 years in business balancing million dollar budgets and managing a large global sales team" Chrissy said. "In business, the absolute last option is raising prices for your customers, and that seems to be the MTA's first choice. When your costs are going up you do everything in your power to balance your budget so that you can keep prices steady for your customers. The MTA needs to learn how to do the same thing."</p>
    <p>On Wednesday the MTA released its fiscal projections through 2017 which includes two fare hikes of as much as 15%. These increases will be the 5th and 6th times the MTA has raised fares since 2003. Chrissy who regularly uses the Long Island Rail Road and subway system to travel into Manhattan thinks that prices have risen faster than inflation to the point where the average person cannot keep up and can no longer afford a monthly Metrocard. </p>
    <p>"My son and daughter both travel to Manhattan for work and school, and the prices are getting out of control. It is impossible for a young person to buy a monthly Metrocard" Chrissy continued. "I used to take the train and subway to work every single day. When I retired in 2009 it cost $81 for a monthly Metrocard and by 2017 it could be as high as $125."</p>
    <p>Chrissy believes that the MTA can find ways to reduce its costs without negatively impacting service. Among some of the changes that can be easily implemented include ending all perks to MTA Board Members, cross training office staff to work in all divisions of the MTA, and making more space available to advertisers. </p>
    <p>"MTA Board Members do not need drivers or lifetime E-Z Passes. The MTA should be able to consolidate its back office; they don't need separate staff to handle complaints about subways and buses, and we should allow advertisements on the outside of subway cars, and have prerecorded advertising messages that occasionally play over the loudspeaker while riding the LIRR" Chrissy concluded. </p>
