    <div class="about-body">
    <p>Chrissy Voskerichian, candidate for City Council in Northeast Queens, was the first candidate for any office in New York City to file designating petitions in order to secure a place on the ballot for the September primary. Today, July 8, was the first day to file petitions with the Board of Elections' Executive Office in lower Manhattan. </p>
    <p>"I am proud of the hard work of our volunteers.  We collected more than the required number of petition signatures early enough to be the first to file" Chrissy said. "Northeast Queens deserves a Council Member who is going to work hard to make sure that their needs are met, and I am not afraid to wake up early and get to work if that's what it takes to make our community a better place. "</p>
    <p>Chrissy collected 366 pages containing 1465 signatures, almost four times the 450 signatures required to run for City Council.  There are currently at least 313 declared candidates seeking election to all 51 City Council seats, Public Advocate, Comptroller and Mayor.</p>
    <p>"While the petitioning process is outdated and ineffective, I did enjoy meeting hundreds of residents from Northeast Queens. The support I have received from friends, neighbors and strangers is overwhelming" Chrissy continued. "Filing petitions first is merely symbolic of the dedication and work ethic that I will bring to the City Council. "</p>
    <p>Chrissy arrived at the Board of Elections at 5:30am, 3 and a half hours early for the filing period which opened at 9 am. She was first by a narrow margin, as representatives from Sean Gardner's (D- Bronx/Manhattan) City Council campaign arrived at 5:45 am.</p>
