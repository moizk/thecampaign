    	<p>Chrissy Voskerichian is a life long resident of Northeast Queens and an exceptionally dedicated member of her neighborhood. The combination of Chrissy's business, civic, and community experience makes her an ideal candidate for City Council. Chrissy has over 31 years of business experience; she is the Co-founder and Vice-president of her local civic association and has a proven record of serving the people of her community, whom she loves and cares for. </p>
    	<p>After growing up in the Auburndale section of North Flushing, Chrissy made the decision to stay and raise her family just two blocks from the house in which she grew up. Chrissy and Deek, her husband of 29 years, own their single-family home where they raised their two children. Chrissy, who loves cooking, hosts a weekly Sunday dinner for her extended family and friends.</p>
    	<p>Chrissy started working when she was 16 years old as part of a work/study program. She started in the mailroom at AT&T. After only a short time of delivering mail she was quickly given more responsibility. Chrissy has taken that strong work ethic and applied it the rest of her life. After graduating high school a year early Chrissy moved through the ranks of the telecommunications industry, ending as the Director of Global Sales Operations for one of the largest firms in the world.</p>
    	<p>When businesses in Auburndale were getting out of control, Chrissy and her neighbors were faced with a decision: sell their homes and move, or fight back. In response Chrissy co-founded the Station Road Civic Association in 2005. She has worked with over a dozen local businesses to create a better coexistence between residents and business owners. Additionally, the Station Road Civic Association, which now has over 200 members, works towards a goal of addressing all the needs of the community and to being a voice for Auburndale, a picturesque community with beautiful homes nestled amongst sprawling green trees.</p>
    	<p>In 2008 Chrissy became involved with the 109th Precinct Community Council. When Chrissy was elected president of the council, few people were aware of and attended the meetings. Now 5 years and 3 Commanding Officers later, the 109th Precinct Community Council regularly attracts over 100 people to its monthly meetings and is one of the City's largest and most active precinct councils. Chrissy plans and hosts the annual National Night Out Against Crime, which brings over 3000 community members and law enforcement officers together to create an enduring partnership.</p>
    	<p>As Avaya Communications' head sales person, Chrissy oversaw a department of 50 employees, traveled extensively, and managed accounts with many major businesses around the world. After 31 years in business Chrissy retired to focus on her family and community. However, she did not stay retired for long. Less than 6 months after retiring, Chrissy went to work for the New York City Council.</p>
    	<p>As the Director of Constituent Services, and eventually Chief of Staff, Chrissy oversaw one of the most proactive and successful constituent service staffs in the City. Under Chrissy's leadership, over 8,000 constituent cases were addressed, nearly $10 million in funding was allocated to local organizations, and a strong working relationship was established between the government and the community.</p>
    	<p>Chrissy plans to bring her 30+ years of business expertise and extensive community, civic, and government experience to the City Council. She hopes that every family who lives in Northeast Queens will be able to share her story of hard work, determination, and commitment to her neighborhood. In her family, business career, civic and police community roles she worked with everyone as a close-knit team to achieve countless goals and then always celebrated their successes together. That is her vision for Council District 19.</p>
